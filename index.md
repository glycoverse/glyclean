# glyclean

Omics data cleaning and preprocessing is a critical yet cumbersome step.
**glyclean** helps you perform these tasks with ease, so you can focus
on the fun part: downstream analysis!

## Installation

You can install the latest release of glyclean from
[r-universe](https://glycoverse.r-universe.dev/glyclean):

``` r
install.packages('glyclean', repos = c('https://glycoverse.r-universe.dev', 'https://cloud.r-project.org'))
```

Or from [GitHub](https://github.com/glycoverse/glyclean):

``` r
# install.packages("remotes")
remotes::install_github("glycoverse/glyclean@*release")
```

Or install the development version:

``` r
remotes::install_github("glycoverse/glyclean")
```

## Role in `glycoverse`

As data preprocessing is an essential step in omics data analysis,
`glyclean` plays a central role in the `glycoverse` ecosystem. It serves
as the bridge between raw experimental data (imported via `glyread`) and
downstream analysis, enabling other packages like `glystats` to work
with clean, analysis-ready data.

## Example

``` r
library(glyexp)
library(glyclean)
#> 
#> Attaching package: 'glyclean'
#> The following object is masked from 'package:stats':
#> 
#>     aggregate

exp <- real_experiment
clean_exp <- auto_clean(exp)
#> 
#> ── Normalizing data ──
#> 
#> ℹ No QC samples found. Using default normalization method based on experiment type.
#> ℹ Experiment type is "glycoproteomics". Using `normalize_median()`.
#> ✔ Normalization completed.
#> 
#> ── Removing variables with too many missing values ──
#> 
#> ℹ No QC samples found. Using all samples.
#> ℹ Applying preset "discovery"...
#> ℹ Total removed: 24 (0.56%) variables.
#> ✔ Variable removal completed.
#> 
#> ── Imputing missing values ──
#> 
#> ℹ No QC samples found. Using default imputation method based on sample size.
#> ℹ Sample size <= 30, using `impute_sample_min()`.
#> ✔ Imputation completed.
#> 
#> ── Aggregating data ──
#> 
#> ℹ Aggregating to "gfs" level
#> ✔ Aggregation completed.
#> 
#> ── Normalizing data again ──
#> 
#> ℹ No QC samples found. Using default normalization method based on experiment type.
#> ℹ Experiment type is "glycoproteomics". Using `normalize_median()`.
#> ✔ Normalization completed.
#> 
#> ── Correcting batch effects ──
#> 
#> ℹ Batch column  not found in sample_info. Skipping batch correction.
#> ✔ Batch correction completed.
```

Yes, that’s it! Calling the magical
[`auto_clean()`](https://glycoverse.github.io/glyclean/reference/auto_clean.md)
function will automatically perform the following steps, in the most
suitable way for your data:

- Normalization
- Missing value filtering
- Imputation
- Batch effect correction

and other steps that are necessary for downstream analysis.
