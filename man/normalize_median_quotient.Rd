\description{
This approach is based on the calculation of the dilution factor of each
sample with respect to a reference sample. Here, the reference sample
was calculated as the median value of each glycan's abundance across all
measured samples. For each sample, a vector of quotients was then obtained
by dividing each glycan measure by the corresponding value in the reference
sample. The median of these quotients was then used as the sample's dilution
factor, and the original sample values were subsequently divided by that value.
The underlying assumption is that the diﬀerent intensities observed across
individuals are imputable to diﬀerent amounts of the biological material
in the collected samples.
