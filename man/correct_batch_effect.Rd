\title{Correct Batch Effect}
\usage{
correct_batch_effect(x, batch = "batch", group = NULL)
}
\arguments{
\item{x}{Either a \code{glyexp_experiment} object or a matrix.
If a matrix, rows should be variables and columns should be samples.}

\item{batch}{Either a factor/character vector specifying batch assignments for each sample,
or a string specifying the column name in sample_info (for experiment input only).
Default to "batch" for experiment input.}

\item{group}{Either a factor/character vector specifying group assignments for each sample,
or a string specifying the column name in sample_info (for experiment input only).
If provided, it will be used as a covariate in the ComBat model.
This is useful when you have an unbalanced design.
Default to NULL.}
}
\value{
For \code{glyexp_experiment} input, returns a modified \code{glyexp_experiment} object.
For matrix input, returns a batch-corrected matrix.

\description{
Correct batch effects in glycoproteomics/glycomics data using ComBat algorithm
from the sva package.
}
\details{
This function performs batch effect correction using the ComBat algorithm.
It requires batch information provided via the \code{batch} parameter.
If no batch information is available, the function will return the original data unchanged.

If group information is provided via \code{group},
the function will check for confounding between batch and group variables.
If batch and group are highly confounded (complete overlap),
the function will issue a warning and return the original data unchanged
to avoid over-correction.

When both batch and group information are available and not highly confounded,
the group information will be included in the model to preserve biological variation
while correcting for batch effects.

# With glyexp_experiment and column names
exp <- glyexp::toy_experiment()
exp$sample_info$batch <- c("A", "A", "A", "B", "B", "B")
exp$sample_info$group <- c("Ctrl", "Ctrl", "Treat", "Ctrl", "Treat", "Treat")

# With matrix and factor vectors
mat <- matrix(rnorm(200), nrow = 20, ncol = 10)
batch_factor <- factor(rep(c("A", "B"), each = 5))
group_factor <- factor(rep(c("Ctrl", "Treat"), times = 5))
