\title{Correct Batch Effect}
\usage{
correct_batch_effect(exp)
}
\arguments{
\item{exp}{A \code{glyexp_experiment} object containing glycoproteomics/glycomics data.}
}
\value{
A \code{glyexp_experiment} object with batch-corrected expression matrix.
}
\description{
Correct batch effects in glycoproteomics/glycomics data using ComBat algorithm
from the sva package. This function requires batch information in the sample_info.
}
\details{
This function performs batch effect correction using the ComBat algorithm.
It requires a "batch" column in the sample information.
If no batch information is available, the function will return the original experiment unchanged.

If a "group" column exists in the sample information,
the function will check for confounding between batch and group variables.
If batch and group are highly confounded (complete overlap),
the function will issue a warning and return the original experiment unchanged
to avoid over-correction.

When both batch and group information are available and not highly confounded,
the group information will be included in the model to preserve biological variation
while correcting for batch effects.

\examples{
# Create an experiment with batch information
exp <- glyexp::toy_experiment()
exp$sample_info$batch <- c("A", "A", "A", "B", "B", "B")
exp$sample_info$group <- c("Ctrl", "Ctrl", "Treat", "Ctrl", "Treat", "Treat")

# Correct batch effects
corrected_exp <- correct_batch_effect(exp)
