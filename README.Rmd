Omics data cleaning and preprocessing is a critical yet cumbersome step.
**glyclean** helps you perform these tasks with ease,
so you can focus on the fun part: downstream analysis!

## Installation

You can install the latest release of glyclean from [GitHub](https://github.com/) with:

``` r
# install.packages("remotes")
remotes::install_github("glycoverse/glyclean@*release")
```

Or install the development version:

``` r
remotes::install_github("glycoverse/glyclean")
```

## Documentation

## Role in `glycoverse`

As data preprocessing is an essential step in omics data analysis,
`glyclean` plays a central role in the `glycoverse` ecosystem.
It serves as the bridge between raw experimental data (imported via `glyread`) and downstream analysis,
enabling other packages like `glystats` to work with clean, analysis-ready data.

## Example

```{r}
library(glyexp)
library(glyclean)

exp <- real_experiment
clean_exp <- auto_clean(exp)
```

Yes, that's it!
Calling the magical `auto_clean()` function will automatically perform the following steps,
in the most suitable way for your data:

- Normalization
- Missing value filtering
- Imputation
- Batch effect correction

and other steps that are necessary for downstream analysis.
