Omics data cleaning and preprocessing is a critical yet cumbersome step.
**glyclean** helps you perform these tasks with ease, so you can focus
on the fun part: downstream analysis! Inspired by `mlr3pipelines`,
**glyclean** uses a pipeline-based approach to arrange data cleaning and
preprocessing steps in a modular and flexible way, so that different
steps can be easily combined and customized, in any order.

## Installation

You can install the development version of glyclean from
[GitHub](https://github.com/) with:

``` r
# install.packages("pak")
pak::pak("glycoverse/glyclean")
```

## Example

Coming soon!
