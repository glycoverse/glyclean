Omics data cleaning and preprocessing is a critical yet cumbersome step.
**glyclean** helps you perform these tasks with ease, so you can focus
on the fun part: downstream analysis!

## Installation

You can install the development version of glyclean from
[GitHub](https://github.com/) with:

``` r
# install.packages("pak")
pak::pak("glycoverse/glyclean")
```

## Example

``` r
library(glyexp)
library(glyclean)
#> 
#> Attaching package: 'glyclean'
#> The following object is masked from 'package:stats':
#> 
#>     aggregate

exp <- toy_experiment()
exp <- set_exp_type(exp, "glycomics")
clean_exp <- auto_clean(exp)
```

Yes, thatâ€™s it! Calling the magical `auto_clean()` function will
automatically perform the following steps, in the most suitable way for
your data:

-   Normalization
-   Missing value filtering
-   Imputation
-   Batch effect correction

and other steps that are necessary for downstream analysis.
