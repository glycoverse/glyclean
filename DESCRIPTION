Description: 
    Provides comprehensive data preprocessing tools for glycomics and 
    glycoproteomics experiments. The package offers both automated and manual 
    preprocessing pipelines, including normalization (median, quantile, vsn, 
    total area), missing value handling (filtering, imputation using various 
    methods), batch effect correction (using ComBat and other methods), data 
    aggregation (at peptide, glycan, or site level), and quality control 
    functions. The automated pipeline intelligently selects appropriate methods 
    based on data characteristics and sample size, making it easy to prepare 
    clean, analysis-ready data for downstream statistical analysis within the 
    glycoverse ecosystem. Works seamlessly with 'glyexp::experiment()' objects 
    to ensure data consistency and interoperability.
